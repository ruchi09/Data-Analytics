# Data-Analytics

#### This repository represents a collection of data analytics techniques applied for a Flight database. The operations includes:
  
  1) **Clustering**: Clustering of flights on the basis of profitability. It uses the data file named
                  flight.csv (which has columns namely flight name,occupied seats, available seats)
                  
  2) **Classification**: Classifies the flights into delayed, on time and cancelled on the basis of wind speed,
                        weather etc. The parameters of schedule.csv are already mapped to integers
                        
  3) **ARM** : ARM is applied on the flight paths (with hops) to search for most frequent paths/places travelled. This will help in discovering
            new business opportunities. routes.csv is the data file used for this.
            
            
            
The data generators are provided for **routes.csv** and **flight.csv**. **schedule.csv** was manually created.
